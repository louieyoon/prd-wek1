# Lotto Number Generator

## Overview

This is a simple web application that generates random lottery numbers. It's built using modern web technologies, including Web Components, to create a reusable and encapsulated lottery number generator.

## Design and Features

### Layout & Style
- **Responsive Design:** The layout adapts to different screen sizes, making it mobile-friendly.
- **Modern Aesthetics:** The design features a clean and visually balanced layout with a subtle noise texture on the background, multi-layered drop shadows for depth, and a vibrant color palette.
- **Typography:** Expressive typography is used to create a clear visual hierarchy.
- **Interactivity:** Interactive elements like buttons have a "glow" effect to enhance user experience.

### Functionality
- **Number Generation:** Clicking the "Generate Numbers" button generates 6 unique random numbers between 1 and 45.
- **Web Component:** The entire functionality is encapsulated within a `<lotto-generator>` custom element for reusability.

## Current Plan

- **Phase 1: HTML Structure**
    - Update `index.html` to include the main structure of the application and the `<lotto-generator>` custom element.
- **Phase 2: Styling**
    - Create a modern and visually appealing design in `style.css` using modern CSS features.
- **Phase 3: JavaScript Logic**
    - Implement the `<lotto-generator>` custom element in `main.js`.
    - The component will handle the generation of unique random numbers and display them.
